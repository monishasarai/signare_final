Signature Verification System
Project Overview
The Signature Verification System is a web-based application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application is designed to verify the authenticity of cheque signatures in financial transactions. By comparing an uploaded signature against a stored signature in the database, it determines whether the signature is genuine or forged. This project leverages deep learning models for high accuracy in signature verification.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and signup system for users.
Signature Upload: Users can upload signatures for verification.
Database Integration: Signature data and user information are stored in MongoDB.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for signature comparison (e.g., ResNet, VGG16).
Frontend Interface: Built with REACT, providing a smooth user experience for signing up, logging in, and verifying signatures.
